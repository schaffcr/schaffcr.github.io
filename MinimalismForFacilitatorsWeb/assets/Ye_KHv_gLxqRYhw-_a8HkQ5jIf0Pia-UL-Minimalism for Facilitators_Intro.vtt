00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.133


2
00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:09.866
Meet Lily.
Lily is a facilitator in the

3
00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:13.700
ITS Learning and Client
Performance (LCP) department.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.066
Her manager assigned her to
update the “Teller

5
00:00:16.066 --> 00:00:18.300
Transactions” Virtual Trainer
course.

6
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.100
As Lily updates this course,
she applies ITS Minimalism

7
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.566
Standards to produce the best
quality course.

8
00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:25.200


9
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.000
After following along with
Lily, you will also be able to

10
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.766
apply Minimalism in your course
design projects.

11
00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:32.733


12
00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:36.600
Minimalism is focusing on the
content our learners need and

13
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.833
value most by removing anything
that could distract from it.

14
00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:42.800
It's about subtracting quantity
to add quality.

15
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.933
Let’s compare two sets of
instructions and see how

16
00:00:45.933 --> 00:00:49.200
Minimalism can benefit us as
learners or end users.

17
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.433


18
00:00:49.433 --> 00:00:54.733
In order to activate the
telephone for use, the user
must press the Power (PWR)

19
00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:59.666
button and hold it for a
duration of 0.4 seconds.
Then the button is released.

20
00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:04.066
Turning on the phone - Press
and hold the PWR button until

21
00:01:04.066 --> 00:01:06.466
the light comes on and the bell
rings.

22
00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:07.033


23
00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.466
Which example did you find
easier to follow?

24
00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:11.000


25
00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.066
Which example would you be more
likely to spot if you were
scanning a learner guide for

26
00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.366
instructions on how to turn on
your phone?

27
00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:18.000


28
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.400
Which one felt like it was
written with you in mind?

29
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:21.900


30
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.900
As you may have guessed, the
second choice reflects
Minimalism.

31
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.500
Even this simple example
reveals that Minimalism

32
00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.300
provides clear benefits to
learners and end users.

33
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.466


34
00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:35.900
The ITS Minimalism Standards
include four principles:

35
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.300
focus on the user or learner,

36
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.366
take an action-oriented
approach,

37
00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.400
support access, and

38
00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.366
support error recognition and
recovery.

39
00:01:45.366 --> 00:01:50.666
The first two apply most
directly to the type of content
facilitators design, while the

40
00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:53.900
last two apply more to content
created by technical writers,

41
00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.066
so this course addresses the
first two.

42
00:01:56.066 --> 00:01:57.133


43
00:01:57.133 --> 00:02:02.300
Specifically, after completing
this course, you will be able
to design courses that

44
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.133
focus on the learner by
removing excess information

45
00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:08.033
and take an action-
oriented approach by focusing

46
00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:10.666
on tasks rather than system
functionality.

47
00:02:10.666 --> 00:02:13.933
Let's begin by following along
as Lily applies the first

48
00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.366
Minimalism principle to her
course update.
