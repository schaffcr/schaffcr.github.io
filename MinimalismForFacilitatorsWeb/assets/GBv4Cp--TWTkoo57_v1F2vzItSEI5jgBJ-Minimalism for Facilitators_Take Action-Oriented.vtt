Lily organizes the content for
the updated “Teller
Transactions” course by

3
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.566
considering what learners like
Tom Teller need to do on the

4
00:00:13.566 --> 00:00:16.433
job rather than the structure
of the teller system.

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:19.466
She uses this thought process
to provide information in

6
00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.000
context and write helpful
titles and headers.

approach to designing content
by focusing on tasks rather
than system functionality.
