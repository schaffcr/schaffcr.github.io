00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:11.533
Lily begins her update of the
“Teller Transactions” course by
making sure she includes the

3
00:00:11.533 --> 00:00:14.466
most important and valuable
content for the audience.

4
00:00:14.466 --> 00:00:19.300
Then she practices minimalist
writing techniques to ensure
learners can easily identify

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.666
and process the important
information.

6
00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:21.933


7
00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:26.500
After following along as Lily
applies these techniques, you
too will be able to write

8
00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.333
content that focuses on the
learner by removing excess
information.

9
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:30.600


10
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.600
In order to focus content on
the learner, Lily must first

11
00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.733
identify who the learners are
most likely to be for this
course.

12
00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:42.233
She does this by selecting one
of the personas from the ITS
personas list.

13
00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:45.100
This course is about completing
transactions in the teller

14
00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.466
system, so Tom Teller is a
great persona choice.

15
00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:51.933
As Lily designs the course, she
asks herself whether the

16
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:55.266
content is something that Tom
Teller needs to know to do his
job.

17
00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:58.700
If it’s not, then she likely
doesn’t need to include it.

18
00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.933
Scroll down to learn more about
the techniques Lily uses to
select the right content and

19
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:06.366
write the course so that it
focuses on the learners.
